# Loan_Approval_Prediction
1) Our purpose to start with simple project like this project.
2) Here we will learn many basic things that help to improve our basic knowledge and information about machine learning algorithms.
3) Here we also learn about visualization process of data because here I use matplotlib and seaborn to better understanding of data visually.
4) At the end of the project I implement model like software. So, we can type our parameteres and predict for loan approving or not.
